        <p>Welcome to my professional portfolio. This site showcases my academic achievements, technical skills, and project experiences in Electrical and Computer Engineering. Currently, it features a barebones, simplistic design, but I am continually working to enhance and upgrade it. My goal is to provide a comprehensive overview of my capabilities and potential contributions while connecting with engineering recruiters and industry professionals. Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to engaging with you.</p>
